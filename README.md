# NZ Vaccine Pass Verifier (JS/Browser, offline)

## Quickstart

Either download this repository and open `index.html`, or try it online at https://aha-aha-aha.github.io/JsNzCovidPassVerifier/

## Information

The goal was, to create a browser based, JS based verification app for New Zealand vaccine passports. This means, no information is sent to the internet.

The app is built to the specifications of the Ministry of Health, NZ: https://nzcp.covid19.health.nz/

## Certificates

The certificates are currently hardcoded and need to be downloaded regularly from https://nzcp.identity.health.nz/.well-known/did.json .
